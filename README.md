# Data-Science-Course
This repository contains the script(s) I used for my final project of the data science course (Stat 591C, West Virginia University, Fall 2016).
The task was to analyze data about social media activity. Datasets were provided for two social media, Tom's Hardware and Twitter.
The data can be found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Buzz+in+social+media+

The task was to predict whether or not a given instance will create a buzz in social media.
